## Part 1: The Core

| Field | Answer |
|-------|--------|
| **Business Name** | Foxy John's |
| **Location Hook** | Main Street, Dingle - where 1,500 people support 50+ pubs |
| **The One Thing** | Ireland's most charming contradiction: a pub where you can buy nails, rent a bike, and catch a trad session - all in the same room |
| **The Hook** | "Pint of Guinness and a box of screws, please." |
| **The Feeling** | Delighted curiosity, cozy belonging, joyful absurdity |

**The One Thing** - What sets Foxy John's apart isn't just that it's a hardware pub (Dingle has a few of those). It's the perfect collision of the practical and the convivial: the ceiling hung with tools, the snug tucked beside the hammers, the seamless transition from afternoon bike rental to evening pints - and somehow it all makes complete sense.

**The Hook** - A line that captures the beautiful absurdity. Real customers have literally ordered drinks and hardware in the same breath since 1899.

**The Feeling** - First-time visitors should feel delighted surprise ("Wait, is that rat poison behind the bar?"), then comfortable belonging (this is how it's always been done), wrapped in warm Irish humor.

## Part 2: Positioning

| Field | Answer |
|-------|--------|
| **The Enemy** | Tourist-trap pubs with no soul, fake "authenticity" |
| **The Transformation** | Curious visitor becomes a regular with a story to tell |
| **Why Now** | In a world of homogenized experiences, the genuine article is rare |

**The Enemy** - The opposite of Foxy John's is a "traditional Irish pub" designed by a marketing committee. Themed decor bought in bulk. Staff who don't know your name. A place that exists for photos, not pints.

**The Transformation** - A tourist walks in confused by the hardware. An hour later, they're in the snug, talking to a local about Connor Pass, planning to rent a bike tomorrow, wondering why every pub isn't like this.

**Why Now** - Foxy John's has been doing its thing for 125 years. The world finally caught up. Star Wars found them. The internet found them. But they didn't change a thing.

## Part 3: Proof & Voice

| Field | Answer |
|-------|--------|
| **Hard Proof** | Established 1899 (125+ years). Star Wars wrap party venue (Mark Hamill & Daisy Ridley, 2016). Scoundrel's Field Guide 10/10. |
| **Soft Proof** | Four generations of the same approach. Daisy Ridley pulled pints behind the bar. The snug. Hundreds of TripAdvisor reviews calling it "Ireland's most unique pub" |
| **Voice (3 adjectives)** | Dryly witty, warmly practical, unpretentious |
| **They Would Say** | "Ah sure, we've always done it this way. Want a pint while you browse the screwdrivers?" |
| **They Would Never Say** | "Experience our curated selection of artisanal hardware in our Instagram-worthy heritage space" |

**Hard Proof** - 125 years. If they were doing something wrong, someone would have mentioned it by now.

**Soft Proof** - Mark Hamill chose Foxy John's for the Star Wars wrap party. Not the fancy hotel. Not the Michelin-starred restaurant. Foxy John's. That says everything.

**Voice** - The humor should be bone-dry, delivered with a straight face. Like selling rat poison beside the whiskey and not even remarking on it. Like having "Pub, Hardware, Bicycles" on the sign as if that's perfectly normal. Because here, it is.

## Part 4: The Visitor

| Field | Answer |
|-------|--------|
| **Primary Visitor** | Tourist planning a Dingle Peninsula trip, searching "unique things to do in Dingle" or "best pubs Dingle" |
| **What They Want** | An authentic experience. Something to tell friends about. Good craic. |
| **What They Fear** | Tourist traps. Wasting precious holiday time on forgettable places. |
| **The Answer** | You can't manufacture 125 years. You can't fake a hardware store that still sells hardware. Come see for yourself. |

## Key Copy Blocks

### Hero

**Headline:**
> Pub. Hardware. Bicycles.

**Subhead:**
> Since 1899, Foxy John's has been serving pints, selling nails, and renting bikes on Dingle's Main Street. We see no reason to stop now.

**Primary CTA:**
> Find Us on Main Street

**Secondary CTA:**
> Rent a Bike

---

### About Section

**Opening:**
> Walk through our green doors and you'll notice something odd. On your left: Guinness, whiskey, the crackle of a trad session starting up. On your right: screwdrivers, nails, a bicycle pump, and yes - that is rat poison behind the bar. Welcome to Foxy John's.

**Middle:**
> In 2016, after filming wrapped on Star Wars: The Last Jedi, the cast needed somewhere to celebrate. Mark Hamill walked in at 11pm with his dog. Daisy Ridley ended up pulling pints. They chose Foxy John's because you can't fake what we have. You certainly can't build it. You can only let 125 years of business make its own kind of sense.

**Close:**
> The snug is to your left. It's a narrow wooden booth with a window to the street and its own drink hatch to the bar. Get there early - the locals know about it too. This is how Dingle has always worked: community first, categories second. Need a pint? Need a chisel? Need someone to tell you the best route over Connor Pass? Pull up a stool.

## Design Direction

Based on the brief above:

**Primary Color:** Traditional Irish Green (from the storefront) - deep forest green, not bright

**Secondary Color:** Deep gloss yellow (from the 1950s interior walls)

**Accent Color:** Red (the door)

**Typography Feel:** Practical and confident. Nothing fancy. A serif that could be on a vintage sign, paired with something readable. Think old shop signage, not tech startup.

**Photo Treatment:** Warm, candid, imperfect. Real photos of the interior chaos - tools on ceiling, the snug, pints on the hardware counter. Full-bleed hero of the green exterior.

**Layout Priority:** Photo-dominant. Let the visuals tell the story. The hardware-behind-the-bar shot is worth a thousand words.

## Quality Check

Before handoff to design:

- [x] The One Thing is genuinely differentiating (not generic)
- [x] The Hook would make someone stop scrolling
- [x] Voice matches how they actually talk
- [x] No "Learn More" or "Contact Us" in CTAs
- [x] Every copy block reinforces The One Thing
- [x] Nothing here would make the owner cringe
