## What Makes It Unique

Foxy John's is one of Ireland's famous "hardware pubs" - establishments that combine a traditional pub with a hardware store and other services. The sign above the door gives equal weight to all three functions: **Pub, Hardware Store, and Bicycle Rental/Repair**.

**Left side:** Order a Guinness or Irish whiskey
**Right side:** Buy nails, screwdrivers, tape, rubber gloves, chisels - or rent a bike
